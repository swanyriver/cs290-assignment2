        My name is Brandon Swanson and I am 30 years old
        I am very much enjoying the Ecampus program so far.  I live in the bay area Califorina and am looking forward to it being warm enough to go surfing again.
        <br><br>
        My interest in programming began at home learning BASIC,  decades ago, then in highschool c++ and Visual Basic, and in college c,  but obviously I went on to pursue a degree in another field.
        I later went on to learn some Iphone/Android programming during spare time, learning the concepts of OOP along the way, and decided to begin studying it again.
        <br><br>
        Over this last break I learned Python and used it to solve about 60 of the Euler Project problems.  It was a great way to learn a new language and keep my problem solving skills sharp between terms.  There are a lot of features of Python I really enjoy and found it very fast to develop in.
